/*
 * This is an example of how to commit several types of changes to a repository:
 *  - a new directory with a file,
 *  - modification to anexisting file,
 *  - copying a directory into a branch,
 *  - deletion of the directory and its entries.
 *
 * Main aspects of performing a commit with the help of ISVNEditor:
 * 0)initialize the library (this is done in setupLibrary() method);
 *
 * 1)create an SVNRepository driver for a particular  repository  location, that
 * will be the root directory for committing - that is all paths that are  being
 * committed will be below that root;
 *
 * 2)provide user's authentication information - name/password, since committing
 * generally requires authentication;
 *
 * 3)"ask" your SVNRepository for a commit editor:
 *
 *     ISVNCommitEditor editor = SVNRepository.getCommitEditor();
 *
 * 4)"edit"  a repository - perform a sequence of edit calls (for
 * example, here you "say" to the server that you have added such-and-such a new
 * directory at such-and-such a path as well as a new file). First of all,
 * ISVNEditor.openRoot()  is called to 'open' the root directory;
 *
 * 5)at last you close the editor with the  ISVNEditor.closeEdit()  method  that
 * fixes your modificaions in the repository finalizing the commit.
 *
 * For  each  commit  a  new  ISVNEditor is required - that is after having been
 * closed the editor can no longer be used!
 *
 * This example can be run for a locally installed Subversion repository via the
 * svn:// protocol. This is how you can do it:
 *
 * 1)after   you   install  the   Subversion  pack (available  for  download  at
 * http://subversion.tigris.org)  you  should  create  a  new  repository in  a
 * directory, like this (in a command line under a Windows OS):
 *
 * >svnadmin create X:\path\to\rep
 *
 * 2)after the repository is created you can add a new account: navigate to your
 * repository root (X:\path\to\rep\),  then  move  to  \conf  and  open the file
 * 'passwd'. In the file you'll see the section [users]. Uncomment it and add  a
 * new account below the section name, like:
 *
 * [users]
 * userName = userPassword.
 *
 * In the program you may further use this account as user's credentials.
 *
 * 3)the next step is to launch the custom Subversion  server  (svnserve)  in  a
 * background mode for the just created repository:
 *
 * >svnserve -d -r X:\path\to
 *
 * That's all. The repository is now available via svn://localhost/rep.
