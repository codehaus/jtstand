/**
 * A "code template" is a kind of macro for commonly-typed code.  It
 * associates a short identifier with a longer code snippet, then when the
 * code template is enabled and the short identifier is typed, it is
 * replaced with the longer code snippet.<p>
 *
 * For example, you can associate the identifier <code>forb</code>
 * (short for "for-block") with the following code:<p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   for (&lt;caret&gt;) {
 *
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then, whenever you type <code>forb</code> followed by a trigger
 * (e.g., a space) into a text area with this <code>CodeTemplate</code>,
 * the code snippet is added in place of <code>forb</code>.  Further,
 * the caret is placed at the position denoted by <code>&lt;caret&gt;</code>.<p>
 *
 * Static text replacements are done with {@link StaticCodeTemplate}.  Dynamic
 * templates can also be created and used.
