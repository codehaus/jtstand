Development

* Tools

 JTStand is mostly written in Java.
 Java sources can be compiled using Sun's {{{http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp}Java Development Kit 6}} or
 {{{http://openjdk.java.net/}OpenJDK 6}}.
 User Interface is developed using the standard Java {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29}Swing Widget toolkit}} and also uses {{{https://swingx.dev.java.net/}swingx}}, which is an extension of Swing (still in development).

 Drivers and libraries can be called from steps of JTStand Sequence, using JNA or JNI the Java Native Interface. Some C programming is required when writing a JNI wrapper. Examples will be provided. Drivers, which will be sub-projects of JTStand, will use JNI technology, but the JTStand core will not be dependent of JNI.

 JTStand is developed and tested on Operating Systems:

  * {{{http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsxp/default.mspx}Windows XP}}

  * {{{http://distrowatch.com/}Linux}} - Recommended Linux distribution: {{{http://www.opensuse.org/}OpenSUSE}}

| {{{http://xml-copy-editor.sourceforge.net/} XML Copy Editor}} |  Validating XML editor | Edit and validate XML files.  Do not load the IDE to edit a single XML file and do not use Notepad, because it won't validate! |
*--+--+--+
| {{{http://www.jedit.org/} jEdit}} | Editor which also includes a validating XML editor | Same as XML Copy Editor.  Use either one. |

* Development Philosophy

  * Do not invent the wheel

    * Use the best technology what is available.

    * Learn how to use it more effectively.

  * In order to avoid future problems, design the software with

    * Extensibility

    * Performance

    * {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability}Scalability}}

  * Not enough that it works, maintain the {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code}sources}}!

    * Use auto-formatting tools for maintaining the nice look

    * Use {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactor}refactoring}} tools for maintaining the readability

  * The most important feature of the User Interface is usability.
    Usability is what helps the operator focusing on the task, without forcing him/her to think.

  * The User Interface must look clean, remove the clutter!

  * Braking the {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility}backward compatibility}} is not always avoidable

    * Assign a new version number label

    * Document the differences

    * Develop migration tools if necessary
